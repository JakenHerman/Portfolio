This portfolio is some of the academic work I have completed over the past few years as well as some of the web development work I have done for Sam Houston State University.

# 404 Friends
This is a silly little page I made for fun one day when I was thinking about creating custom 404 pages. Basically, it looks like a command line prompt and asks if you like puppies or kittens. If you type "Puppies", it shows a GIF of a puppy. If you type "Kittens", it shows a GIF of a kitten. This uses the Giphy API and some JavaScript for most of the functionality. Obviously HTML/CSS were used. This CSS was generated via Sass, though - I used Sass to create the styling.

##Tech Used in 404 Friends:
 - Giphy API
 - JavaScript
 - HTML
 - Sass
