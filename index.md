## Jaken Herman Portfolio

This portfolio is some of the academic work I have completed over the past few years as well as some of the web development work I have done for Sam Houston State University.

# 404 Friends
This is a silly little page I made for fun one day when I was thinking about creating custom 404 pages. Basically, it looks like a command line prompt and asks if you like puppies or kittens. If you type "Puppies", it shows a GIF of a puppy. If you type "Kittens", it shows a GIF of a kitten. If you don't give it a valid command, it tells you so.
Tech/Concepts Used in 404 Friends:
---
 - Giphy API
 - JavaScript
 - HTML
 - Sass
 - Git VCS

#BubbaSim
This is a Processor Scheduling Simulator I wrote in Java. It simulates the preemptive priority scheduling algorithm for job handling. It has it's own website. [Click here to see BubbaSim Site](http://jakenherman.github.io/BubbaSim). The code is very well commented, structured, and documented. To get the code and look at the documentation, [click here to go to the repository](http://github.com/jakenherman/BubbaSim).

#kcats
kcats is a stack data structure implementation in NodeJS. It was one of my first projects I created while learning Node. It is on NPM and has over 1,000 total downloads. It has functionality to create multiple stacks in one array, so it is a multistack data structure and dynamically allocates storage space if one stack gets too big. kcats has it's own website. [Click here to see kcats Site](http://jakenherman.github.io/kcats). The code is well structured, linted, tested, documented, etc. To get the code and look at the documentation, [click here to go to the repository](http://github.com/jakenherman/kcats) or to see it on npm go to [https://www.npmjs.com/package/kcats](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kcats).
