## Jaken Herman Portfolio

This portfolio is some of the academic work I have completed over the past few years as well as some of the web development work I have done for Sam Houston State University.

# 404 Friends
This is a silly little page I made for fun one day when I was thinking about creating custom 404 pages. Basically, it looks like a command line prompt and asks if you like puppies or kittens. If you type "Puppies", it shows a GIF of a puppy. If you type "Kittens", it shows a GIF of a kitten. If you don't give it a valid command, it tells you so.

# BubbaSim
This is a Processor Scheduling Simulator I wrote in Java. It simulates the preemptive priority scheduling algorithm for job handling. It has it's own website. [Click here to see BubbaSim Site](http://jakenherman.github.io/BubbaSim). The code is very well commented, structured, and documented. To get the code and look at the documentation, [click here to go to the repository](http://github.com/jakenherman/BubbaSim).

# kcats
kcats is a stack data structure implementation in NodeJS. It was one of my first projects I created while learning Node. It is on NPM and has over 1,000 total downloads. It has functionality to create multiple stacks in one array, so it is a multistack data structure and dynamically allocates storage space if one stack gets too big. kcats has it's own website. [Click here to see kcats Site](http://jakenherman.github.io/kcats). The code is well structured, linted, tested, documented, etc. To get the code and look at the documentation, [click here to go to the repository](http://github.com/jakenherman/kcats) or to see it on npm go to [https://www.npmjs.com/package/kcats](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kcats).

# VM Detection
This is just a C file, nothing much to it, really. It looks at the system it's running on and attempts to determine whether or not it is running on a virtual machine.

# SHSU Academic Calendar
This was my first big project working at Sam Houston State University. I had never worked with APIs in JavaScript before, so it was a great learning experience for me, and for that reason I'm very proud of it. [You can see the page here](http://www.shsu.edu/dept/registrar/calendars/academic-calendar.html). It is automated so the dates will actually change depending on what time of the year it is. If you check in the summer, it will show you what's upcoming in the fall. If you check in December, it assumes you want to look at spring dates, etc. You can click on an event and save it to your google calendar or iCal or Outlook. I'm not proud of the code - it's a bit duct taped together, but if you want to look at it, it can be found [here](http://www.shsu.edu/dept/registrar/calendars/academic-cal.js)

# Tweety
Tweety was a NodeJS application I created that allows you to use Twitter through your computer's command line interface. It is on NPM and has over 20,000 total downlaods. Sadly, this program no longer works, as one of it's dependency packages is broken. I have not attempted to maintain this project by rebuilding a separate dependency. [To see the NPM page for tweety, go here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tweety). [To see the website for tweety, go here](http://www.shsu.edu/jch053/tweety/).

#Others
I have done other work not listed here, simply because it is either something I don't have a site for, or it simply isn't that easy to show off. Things like Android work, iOS work (only have dabbled, nothing actual worth anything), Ada Data Structures like BSTs, Topological Sorts, etc. Some of my numerical methods work and assembly code I did not link because I didn't find it interesting enough to show off.

I did create a YouTube video series on how to create a threaded binary search tree in Ada. That can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOSlQdcu43L6-IPYp-kLbWVp6aBxJnl6N).
